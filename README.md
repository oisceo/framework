The Opera Framework [Alpha]
===================
Welcome to The Opera Framework.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/theopera/framework.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/travis-ci-examples/php)

To get an idea if this framework, take a look at the [sample site](https://github.com/theopera/sample-site), 
it demonstrates some of the useful features this framework has to offer.


*Note: this framework is still in development, it's usable but except some unannounced API changes.*

Installation
------------

You will need composer to install this framework.
Run the following command on a new empty directory to get a copy of the framework.

```
composer require theopera/framework
```

Now you need to install the framework with the following.

```
vendor/bin/opera
```
The installer will ask some simple questions to configure the new Opera project and after that you are ready to
start coding on your new project.
